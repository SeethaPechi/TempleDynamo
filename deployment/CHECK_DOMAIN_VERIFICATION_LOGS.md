7. **Check status and logs** - should show verification details

### Method 2: Deployment Logs

2. **Go to Logs** tab
3. **Look for domain-related entries** like:
   - `Domain verification started`
   - `DNS record check`

## Common Verification Issues & Solutions

### If verification is stuck on "verifying":

**Check DNS Records:**
```bash
# Test if your A record is correct
nslookup tamilkovil.com
# Should return: 34.132.134.162

# Test if TXT record exists
nslookup -type=TXT tamilkovil.com
# Should show: replit-user=YOUR_USERNAME
```

**Common Problems:**
1. **Wrong A record IP** - Must be exactly `34.132.134.162`
2. **Missing TXT record** - Must have `replit-user=YOUR_USERNAME`
3. **Multiple A records** - Remove duplicate/conflicting records
4. **TTL too high** - Set to 3600 or lower
5. **DNS not propagated** - Wait up to 48 hours

### If verification fails:

**Solution Steps:**
1. **Double-check IONOS DNS records**
2. **Remove any conflicting records**
3. **Wait 15-30 minutes** for DNS propagation
4. **Try verification again** in Replit

## Manual DNS Check Commands

**Windows:**
```cmd
nslookup tamilkovil.com
nslookup -type=TXT tamilkovil.com
```

**Online Tools:**
- **DNS Checker:** [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)
- **DNS Lookup:** [dns.google](https://dns.google)
- **What's My DNS:** [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net)

## Expected Verification Process

1. **DNS Check** - Replit verifies A record points to 34.132.134.162
2. **TXT Record** - Replit checks for replit-user=YOUR_USERNAME
3. **SSL Certificate** - Automatic SSL certificate generation
4. **Domain Activation** - Domain becomes active
5. **Status: Verified** - Shows green checkmark

## Typical Timeline
- **DNS propagation:** 15 minutes to 48 hours
- **Verification check:** Every 15-30 minutes
- **SSL certificate:** Automatic once verified
- **Total time:** Usually 2-24 hours

## What to Do While Waiting

1. **Verify DNS records** are correct in IONOS
2. **Test DNS propagation** using online tools
3. **Check deployment** works on direct Replit URL
4. **Monitor logs** for any error messages

## If Verification Takes Too Long

**Contact Replit Support:**
- Go to [replit.com/support](https://replit.com/support)
- Mention domain verification issue
- Provide your domain name and Replit username

**Alternative Solution:**
- Use subdomain instead: `www.tamilkovil.com`
- CNAME record easier to verify than A record

The verification process is automatic, but DNS propagation can take time. Most issues are resolved by ensuring the DNS records are exactly correct in IONOS.
