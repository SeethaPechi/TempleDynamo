# EMERGENCY DOMAIN FIX: tamilkovil.com/defaultsite Error

## Problem Analysis
- URL shows `http://tamilkovil.com/defaultsite` (incorrect)
- Connection timeout error
- DNS still returning wrong IP (67.217.246.179 instead of 34.132.134.162)

## Root Cause
The `/defaultsite` suffix indicates IONOS has an active website redirect or hosting service that's interfering with your DNS records.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Remove IONOS Website Services
1. **Login to IONOS Control Panel**
2. **Go to "Website & Shops"** or "Hosting" section
3. **Look for any active services** on tamilkovil.com
4. **Disable/Delete** any of these:
   - Website redirects
   - Hosting packages
   - Website builders
   - Default landing pages

### Step 2: Clean DNS Records in IONOS
1. **Go to Domains** → **tamilkovil.com** → **DNS**
2. **Delete ALL records** except:
   ```
   A     @     34.132.134.162
   A     www   34.132.134.162  
   TXT   @     "replit-user=venkatthirupath"
   ```
3. **Remove these if they exist:**
   - Any other A records
   - CNAME records pointing to IONOS services
   - Any redirect records

### Step 3: Check IONOS Destination Settings
1. **In IONOS Control Panel**
2. **Go to Domain** → **tamilkovil.com**
3. **Look for "Destination" or "Redirect" settings**
4. **Set destination to:** "External" or "Custom DNS"
5. **Remove any IONOS hosting destinations**

## Alternative Quick Fix

### Option A: Use Subdomain First
Test with subdomain while fixing main domain:
1. **Add CNAME record:**
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: app
   Value: your-deployment.replit.app
   ```
2. **Test:** `app.tamilkovil.com`

### Option B: Temporary Replit URL
While fixing domain, use direct Replit deployment URL:
- Deploy your app in Replit
- Use the deployment URL temporarily
- Share that URL with users

## Check These IONOS Settings

### Domain Destination
- Should be set to "External DNS" or "Custom"
- NOT pointing to IONOS hosting/website services

### DNS Zone
- Only the 3 records mentioned above
- No conflicting A records
- No IONOS service CNAMES

### Website Services
- No active website hosting
- No website redirects
- No landing page services

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Direct IP
```cmd
# This should work if DNS is correct
ping 34.132.134.162
```

### Test 2: DNS Resolution
```cmd
# This should return 34.132.134.162
nslookup tamilkovil.com 8.8.8.8
```

### Test 3: HTTP Request
```cmd
# Test direct HTTP (if domain works)
curl -I http://tamilkovil.com
```

## Expected Fix Timeline
- **Remove IONOS services:** 5 minutes
- **DNS propagation:** 15 minutes to 2 hours
- **Domain working:** Within 2 hours

## Success Indicators
1. `nslookup tamilkovil.com` returns `34.132.134.162`
2. No `/defaultsite` in URLs
3. Domain loads Replit deployment
4. No connection timeout errors

The key issue is IONOS has active hosting/redirect services that override your DNS records. Once removed, your domain will point correctly to Replit.
