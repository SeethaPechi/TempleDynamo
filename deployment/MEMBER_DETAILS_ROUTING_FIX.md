# Member Details Routing Fix

## Problem Identified
- URL `https://tamilkovil.replit.app/member-details/4` was returning "page not found"
- Route was defined as `/member/:id` but URL was `/member-details/:id`
- Inconsistent URL patterns causing navigation failures

## Solution Applied
✅ **Added dual route support** for both URL patterns:
- `/member/:id` (original route)
- `/member-details/:id` (new route for compatibility)

## Routes Now Supported
- `https://tamilkovil.replit.app/member/4` ✅
- `https://tamilkovil.replit.app/member-details/4` ✅
- Both routes lead to the same MemberDetails component

## Expected Results
- All member detail links now work correctly
- No more "page not found" errors
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Navigation from family tree and member lists functional

## Next Steps
- Deploy the fix to production
- Test both URL patterns on custom domain
- Verify all navigation links work properly

This fix ensures all member detail page URLs work regardless of which format is used in links throughout the application.
