# Navigation Routing Fix for Custom Domain

## Problem Analysis
Navigation is failing on your custom domain because:
1. **Client-side routing** not properly configured for production
2. **Server not handling SPA routes** - returns 404 for direct navigation
3. **Deployment configuration** missing fallback to index.html

## Root Cause
When users visit `tamilkovil.com/members` directly or refresh the page, the server looks for a physical `/members` file instead of serving the React app that handles routing client-side.

## Solution: Configure Server for SPA Routing

### Step 1: Fix Server Routing Configuration
The server needs to serve `index.html` for all non-API routes to enable client-side routing.

### Step 2: Update Production Deployment
Ensure the deployed version handles all routes properly by serving the React app for any non-API request.

### Step 3: Test All Navigation Routes
After fixing, all these routes should work:
- `tamilkovil.com/` ✓
- `tamilkovil.com/registry` ✓
- `tamilkovil.com/members` ✓
- `tamilkovil.com/family-tree` ✓
- `tamilkovil.com/temples` ✓
- `tamilkovil.com/temple-registry` ✓
- `tamilkovil.com/temple-members` ✓
- `tamilkovil.com/whatsapp` ✓
- `tamilkovil.com/member/123` ✓

## Expected Fix
Once implemented:
1. **Direct navigation** to any page works
2. **Page refresh** maintains current page
3. **Browser back/forward** buttons work
4. **All 9 navigation items** function correctly
5. **URLs stay as your domain** (not Replit URLs)

This is a common SPA (Single Page Application) deployment issue where the server needs to be configured to handle client-side routing properly.
