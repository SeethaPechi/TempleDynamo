# Step-by-Step Domain Fix for tamilkovil.com

## Current Status
- ✅ Your Nam Kovil app is running perfectly in development
- ✅ Database with 47+ members working
- ✅ All 9 navigation items functional
- ❌ Domain tamilkovil.com timing out (DNS misconfiguration)

## Step-by-Step Fix Process

### STEP 1: Deploy to Replit Production
1. **Click the Deploy button** in your Replit interface (top right corner)
2. **Wait for deployment** - this may take 2-5 minutes
3. **Copy your deployment URL** - it will look like: `your-app-name-abc123.replit.app`
4. **Test the deployment URL** - make sure all features work

### STEP 2: Get Your Replit Username
You'll need this for the DNS TXT record:
- Go to your Replit profile
- Your username is in the URL: `replit.com/@YOUR_USERNAME`
- Write it down

### STEP 3: Configure IONOS DNS Records
Login to IONOS and go to your domain DNS settings:

**Delete these if they exist:**
- Any A records pointing to wrong IPs
- Any CNAME records pointing to old URLs
- Any website redirects

**Add these exact records:**
```
Type    Name    Value                          TTL
A       @       34.132.134.162                3600
TXT     @       replit-user=YOUR_USERNAME     3600
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual Replit username.

### STEP 4: Link Domain in Replit
1. **Go to your Replit deployment dashboard**
2. **Click Settings tab**
3. **Click "Link a domain"**
4. **Enter:** `tamilkovil.com`
5. **Click "Link domain"**

### STEP 5: Verify Setup
1. **In Replit:** Click "Verify domain" button
2. **Wait for verification** (can take up to 24 hours)
3. **Test domain:** `https://tamilkovil.com`

## Expected Timeline
- DNS propagation: 15 minutes to 48 hours
- Domain verification: Up to 24 hours
- SSL certificate: Automatic once verified

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### If domain still times out:
1. **Clear DNS cache:** `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows)
2. **Try different device/network**
3. **Check DNS propagation:** Use dnschecker.org
4. **Verify A record:** Should point to 34.132.134.162

### If "domain already linked" error:
1. **Find old repls** with your domain
2. **Unlink domain** from old repls first
3. **Try linking again**

### If SSL certificate issues:
1. **Wait 24 hours** for automatic SSL
2. **Ensure A record is correct**
3. **Check domain verification** in Replit

## Success Criteria
When working correctly:
- `tamilkovil.com` loads your Nam Kovil app
- Green padlock (SSL) in browser
- All 9 navigation items work
- Database shows your member data
- Fast loading with Replit's CDN

## Next Steps After Success
1. **Test all features** on your domain
2. **Share domain** with your community
3. **Monitor performance** in Replit dashboard
4. **Set up analytics** if needed

The key is using Replit's official deployment system and the correct DNS records. The IP 34.132.134.162 is Replit's apex domain proxy that handles all the routing automatically.
